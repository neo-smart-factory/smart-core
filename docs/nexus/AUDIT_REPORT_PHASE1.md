# NEXUS PHASE 1 - SECURITY AUDIT & CODE REVIEW

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Auditor:** Antigravity (Advanced Agentic AI)
**Target:** NEO Nexus Core Foundation
**Version:** v1.0.1 (Phase 1 + Security Hardening)

---

## 🛡️ Executive Summary

The **NEO Nexus** code has been audited and hardened. All critical vulnerabilities identified in original Phase 1 (v1.0.0) have been remediated. The system now enforces strict authentication for both HTTP and WebSocket interfaces, headers security, and rate limiting.

## 🚨 Status of Vulnerabilities

### 1. Unsecured WebSocket Endpoint - [PATCHED]
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Fix:** Implemented manual HTTP upgrade handling in `src/websocket/server.ts`.
- **Mechanism:** Connection is rejected (401 Unauthorized) unless a valid `?token=SECRET` or `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: SECRET` is provided matching the `NEXUS_SECRET`.
- **Verification:** Verified code logic checks `NEXUS_SECRET` using constant-time comparison.

### 2. Missing HTTP Security Headers - [PATCHED]
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Fix:** Added `helmet()` middleware in `src/server.ts`.
- **Impact:** Sets strict security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.).

### 3. Lack of Rate Limiting - [PATCHED]
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Fix:** Added `express-rate-limit` in `src/server.ts`.
- **Configuration:** Limit of 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP.

## 🔒 Security Architecture Overview

| Layer | Protection Mechanism | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HTTP Ingress** | HMAC-SHA256 Signature (`X-Nexus-Signature`) | ✅ Active |
| **WebSocket** | Token Auth (Handshake Upgrade) | ✅ Active |
| **Transport** | Helmet Headers (HSTS, etc.) | ✅ Active |
| **DoS** | Rate Limiting (100req/15min) | ✅ Active |
| **Audit** | SQLite Event Log & Console Logging | ✅ Active |
| **Production** | Mandatory `NEXUS_SECRET` check at startup | ✅ Active |

## 🔍 Remaining Recommendations (Phase 2)

While the critical issues are resolved, keep these in mind for the next phase:

1.  **Rotation Support**: Implement a way to rotate `NEXUS_SECRET` without downtime (e.g., support list of valid secrets).
2.  **Granular Permissions**: Move from "all-or-nothing" socket subscription to role-based access control (RBAC) if multiple different clients (admin vs public) need access.
3.  **Advanced Logging**: Replace console logs with a structured logging library like `winston` for better ELK/Splunk integration.
4.  **Dead Letter Queue**: Implement persistence for failed reactor executions to ensure no event is lost processing.
